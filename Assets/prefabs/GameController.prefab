  roomInfo:
  - 'You awaken and find yourself on the ground in a place you have never seen before.
    The light is dim but you can make out 2 doors. One is in front of you and one
    is behind you. The walls of the room are red. To try to get your bearings, you
    pull out your trusty compass from your pocket. You see that you are facing north.
    You need to find out where you are in hopes of finding your way home.  What will
    you do? '
  - This room is green.
  - This room is yellow.
  - This room is grey.
  - This room is too dark and you cannot see the color of the room. You feel around
    hoping to find a way out.
  - This room is blue.
  - This room is orange.
  - This room is black.
  - This room is fuschia.
  - This room is lavender. There is a panel that you cannot seem to open. Perhaps
    a wrench would help.
